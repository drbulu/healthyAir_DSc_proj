# Traffic Data Preparation I

## Introduction

I learned valuable lessons from the preparation of the Asthma dataset regarding both [strategy](https://github.com/drbulu/healthyAir_DSc_proj/blob/master/01_Data_Prep/asthma_data_source_prep_01.Rmd) and [implementation](https://github.com/drbulu/healthyAir_DSc_proj/blob/master/01_Data_Prep/asthma_data_source_prep_02.Rmd) considerations.


There are potentially many ways of organising this part of the process, but the following workflow is relatively straightforward. Importantly, this phase separates the downloading (aquisition) of the data from the processing of the data into a tidy data format. The reason for this lies in the large number of files to be downloaded.

### Overview

Basically, there are potentially too many quirks, and the tedium and error risk of

Benchmarking using proc.time(), revealed a much better performance using readxl functions over xlsx. Interestingly, processing of the lone xlsx file was faster once update performed!
