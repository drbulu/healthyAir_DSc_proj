## Introduction

### About

This is a data science project to investigate how respiratory health evolves and its relationship with the type and production of various pollutants. Also of interest is the impact of other factors that may define or influence this relationship.

### Background summary:

Respiratory ailments such as [asthma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asthma) constitute an important long term public health concern (some background [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asthma)). Asthma has been linked to a number of factors including particulates <sup>[a](http://europepmc.org/abstract/med/7492903)</sup> <sup>[b](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00039896.1993.9938391)</sup>, extreme [weather events](http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-11-22/two-die-in-thunderstorm-asthma-emergency-in-melbourne/8044558 ) and even [economic status](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00039896.1967.10664708).

### Hypothesis: 

The basic hypotheses that guide this project are that:

* Respirtory health in a given region varies over time and is influenced by the production of certain pollutants.

* The quantities of these pollutants are in turn linked to particular economic activities

* The relationship between respiratory health and pollution is affected by other underlying elements such as meterological and demographic factors.

## Project Structure

These hypotheses will be evaluated through judicious analysis of potentially useful [open data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_data), from which important insights and relationships can be extracted and utilised.
